    <h1 style="color:gold ;">The Sandman</h1>
    <p style="color: gold;">The Sandman is an American fantasy drama television series based on the comic book of the same name written by Neil Gaiman and published by DC Comics. The series was developed by Gaiman, David S. Goyer, and Allan Heinberg for the streaming service Netflix, and is produced by DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Television. Like the comic, The Sandman tells the story of Morpheus / Dream, the titular Sandman. The series stars Tom Sturridge as Morpheus, with Boyd Holbrook, Vivienne Acheampong, and Patton Oswalt in supporting roles.

        Efforts to adapt The Sandman to film began in 1991, and floundered in development hell for many years. In 2013, Goyer pitched a film adaptation of the series to Warner Bros. Goyer and Gaiman were set to produce alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who was planned to star and possibly direct. However, Gordon-Levitt exited over creative differences in 2016. Due to the prolonged development of the film, Warner Bros. shifted its focus to television. Netflix signed a deal to produce the series in June 2019, and filming lasted from October 2020 to August 2021.
        
        The Sandman premiered on August 5, 2022. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise going towards the casting, production design, costumes, visual effects, faithfulness to source material, and performances, particularly those of Sturridge and David Thewlis, though some criticized its pacing and story.Main
        Tom Sturridge as Morpheus / Dream, the personification of dreams and nightmares, and the ruler of the Dreaming.[5][6]
        Ernest Kingsley Jnr as Kai'ckul, an aspect of Dream seen through the eyes of Nada.
        Boyd Holbrook as the Corinthian, a nightmare who escaped the Dreaming.[5]
        Vivienne Acheampong as Lucienne, the librarian of the Dreaming, and its caretaker in Dream's absence.[6][5]
        Patton Oswalt as the voice of Matthew the Raven, Dream's emissary.[7][8]
        Co-starring
        David Thewlis as John Dee, Cripps's and Burgess's son, whose endeavor to find "truth" jeopardizes the world. Gaiman described Dee as a character "who could break your heart and keep your sympathy while taking you into the darkest places".[7][8] In the comics, the character of Dee is the DC supervillain Doctor Destiny.

This series' incarnation of Lucifer is much closer to the character's original depiction in the comics than his depiction in the 2016 Lucifer television series. Neil Gaiman noted that it would be difficult to reconfigure the Lucifer version, portrayed by Tom Ellis, so he would fit back into The Sandman, although having Ellis reprise his role was considered.[5][10]
